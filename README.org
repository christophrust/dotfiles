* Dotfiles

This repo contains most of my dotfiles and, in this readme, a brief documentation of the installation of the basic setup. Prior to going through these steps, all hardware-specific packages should already be installed. Then the steps of this org file should provide at least a basic setup. However, I try to keep this repo up-to-date with my running setup.

** Basic installation

#+begin_src shell
apt-get install i3 git vim emacs ripgrep tmux zathura nextcloud-desktop pass \
    curl htop ffmpeg aspell-en cmake pkg-config pavucontrol fd-find
#+end_src

** Quick setup

The following setup installs some core tools and links the corresponding configuration files for ~tmux~, ~i3~, ~i3-status~, ~vim~,...

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/christophrust/dotfiles
stow i3
stow i3status
stow vim
stow tmux
#+end_src


** Emacs

For emacs, I currently use doom emacs and have the corresponding configuration file in a single repo, [[https://github.com/christophrust/.doom.d][.doom.d]]. To install doom, do

#+begin_src shell
rm -r ~/.emacs.d
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
git clone https://github.com/christophrust/.doom.d/ ~/.doom.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync
#+end_src
